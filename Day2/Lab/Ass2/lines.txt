Sure, I can explain in more detail how the readline module in Node.js works and how the code I provided reads a file line by line.

The readline module in Node.js provides an interface for reading a stream (such as a file or a network socket) one line at a time. It is built on top of the core stream module and provides a more convenient way to read input that is organized into lines.

To use the readline module, we first need to create an instance of the Interface class, which is the main class provided by the module. We do this using the createInterface() method, which takes an options object as its argument.

The input property of the options object specifies the input stream that we want to read line by line. In our case, we are using the fs module to create a read stream from the file "greet.txt" using the createReadStream() method. This means that the readline module will read the file "greet.txt" line by line.

The crlfDelay property of the options object specifies how to handle different line endings. In our code, we are setting it to Infinity, which means that the readline module will treat any of the following as a line ending: a carriage return (\r), a line feed (\n), or a carriage return followed by a line feed (\r\n).

Once we have created an instance of the Interface class, we can listen for the line event using the on() method. This event is emitted by the Interface object every time a new line is read from the input stream. In our code, we have added
All objects that emit events are instances of the EventEmitter class.

These objects expose an eventEmitter.on () function that allows one or more
Functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object.

When the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the Functions attached to that
specific event are called synchronously

Any object can become an EventEmitter through inheritance using:

util.inherits () method.
